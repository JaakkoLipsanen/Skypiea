Final Fight Z is a top-down zombie shooter for Windows Phone that I developed in late 2013. It has global leaderboards and a pretty fun achievement system as well. There are a lot of different weapons, power ups and maps!

Final Fight Z has around 200,000 downloads in the Windows Phone Store and +4.5 rating worldwide.

The game is written in C#/XNA and uses my [Flai.XNA](https://github.com/JaakkoLipsanen/Flai.XNA) engine/library.
